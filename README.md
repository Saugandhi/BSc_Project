# BSc_Project
Welcome to the repository for my Bachelorâ€™s thesis, Linear Algebra in Machine Learning. This project delves into the crucial role linear algebra plays in creating efficient machine learning algorithms. It covers essential topics like matrix operations, vector spaces, transformations, and decomposition methods, showing how these areas of math form the backbone of various machine learning techniques. By breaking down complex algorithms and their practical applications, this project offers both foundational theory and applied insights for anyone interested in the synergy between mathematics and artificial intelligence.
